# DataEngineering_GCP_course4_Serverless-Machine-Learning-with-TensorFlow

Explore and create ML datasets. Sample the dataset and create training, validation, and testing datasets for local development of TensorFlow models.  Create a benchmark to evaluate the performance of ML.  


TensorFlow is used for numerical computations, using directed graphs. Getting started with TensorFlow.  Explore the TensorFlow python API, build a graph, run a graph, feed values into a graph.  Find areas of a triangle using TensorFlow.  


Learning from tf.estimator.  Read from pythonâ€™s pandas dataframe into tf.constant, create feature columns for estimator, perform linear regression with tf.Estimator framework.  Execute Deep Neural Network regression. Use benchmark dataset.   


Refactoring to add batching and feature creation.  Refactor the input.  Refactor the way the features are created. Create and train the model, Evaluate the model.  


Distributed training and monitoring.  Create features out of input data.  Train and evaluate.  Monitor with Tensorboard.   


To run TensorFlow at scale, use Cloud ML Engine.  Package up the code. Find absolute paths to data. Run the python module from the command line. Run locally using GCloud. Submit training job using GCloud. Deploy model. Make predictions.  Train on a 1-million row dataset.  


Feature Engineering.  Working with feature columns.  Adding feature crosses in TensorFlow. Reading data from BigQuery. Creating datasets using Dataflow.  Using a wide-and-deep model.
